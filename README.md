# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tomatofu. I enjoy programming in Python, especially using the Pygame-CE module.

Here's what I'm working on:
 - Cookiedough, a game utilizing Pygame-CE which is a clone (with my own additions/changes) of the well-known game Cookie Clicker
 - Studying for my final exams.

Currently, I don't really do that much stuff on Github, but I will most likely start soon.
